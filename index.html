        <p>This whole block is an actual html div, nothing special about it.</p>
        <p>The floating 3d objects however are rendered in two canvas elements - one for foreground and one for background.</p>
        <p>They are rendered using three.js w/ two identical cameras, but w/ different frustums.</p>
        <p>Bg camera frustum renders everything behind this block, and the fg camera frustum renders everything in front.</p>
        <p>The effect makes it seem like an html div is immersed in a three.js scene, but actually the div is wrapped with two 3d renderers splitting the 3d world at the div plane.</p>
